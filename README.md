## Description
Celia's Portfolio is a web application built using React, which is aimed at displaying Celia's creativity across various fields like graphic design and web development, while also providing an easy way to connect with her. During the development process, I encountered some challenges, especially with the lightbox gallery on the Design Gallery page. The default behaviour of the React Lightbox caused issues with image loading, especially on smaller screens.

To solve these problems, I implemented optimizations in image loading using CSS. While the loading time for the first image in the Lightbox may be slightly longer, these enhancements have significantly improved the Lightbox's overall functionality. Users can now enjoy a smoother experience when interacting with design items.

My commitment to the continual refinement and expansion of Celia's portfolio remains unwavering. Future updates will introduce new features, address any raising challenges, and maintain a better user experience. Thank you for exploring Celia's Portfolio!
